# CSShapeGenerator
Generate a custom Shape with CSS and then download it as PNG in your computer. Usefull for web designers and developers, graphic designers, students learning css etc. I'ts totally free and open source.

# Example on how to use it:
![image](https://github.com/RazorOnDev/CSShapeGenerator/assets/74922874/c33d33c4-f252-4843-9c98-e49d4edcacb5)

In this image there is the following CSS Code in the text input:
`background-color: red;
border-radius: 30px;
border-width: 0`

So, the app generates a shape with that styles under the text input which you can download it in your computer by pressing the "Download as PNG" button

# Free & open-source
I did this simple website because I need that functionality in a project, but it's totally free and you can you can do whatever you want with this repo.
